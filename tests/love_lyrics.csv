word,lyrics
love,"[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, na-na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, na-na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na-na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na-na
Drunk in love, I want you (Ah)
[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
We woke up in the kitchen
Sayin', ""How the hell did this shit happen?""
Oh, baby
Drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love"
