Hey emo boy

[Verse 1]
Saw this boy at the mall last week
Got the kind of look to make me freak
That long ass hair with the tightest jeans
My Chemical Romance on his tee
He looks so sick like he was dyin'
If I said he wasn’t hot then I'd be lyin'
Please, handsome, 
don’t be coy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
[Pre-Chorus]
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy"
